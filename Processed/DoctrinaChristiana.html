<p class="first">I want here to express my thanks and appreciation to
Mr. Lessing J. Rosenwald, through whose kindness this unique Doctrina
was presented to the Library of Congress and with whom the idea of this
publication originated. His interest and enthusiasm made possible my
work, and his friendly advice and encouragement have been both valuable
and heart-warming.</p>
<p>I also wish to thank others who have given me great assistance. They
are Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach to whom I continually turned for advice, Dr.
Lawrence C. Wroth of the John Carter Brown Library and Dr. Leslie W.
Dunlap of the Library of Congress who very kindly read over my
manuscript and gave me the benefit of their suggestions and criticisms,
Mr. David C. Mearns and Miss Elsie Rackstraw of the Library of Congress
and Mrs. Ruth Lapham Butler of the Ayer Collection of the Newberry
Library who so freely and generously made available to me the great
collections of works on the Philippines in their libraries, Dr. John H.
Powell of the Free Library of Philadelphia who helped me find reference
books of the utmost importance, and the many librarians who courteously
answered written queries about early Philippine material. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Doctrina Christiana</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first book printed in the Philippines has been the
object of a hunt which has extended from Manila to Berlin, and from
Italy to Chile, for four hundred and fifty years. The patient research
of scholars, the scraps of evidence found in books and archives, the
amazingly accurate hypotheses of bibliographers who have sifted the
material so painstakingly gathered together, combine to make its
history a bookish detective story par excellence.</p>
<p>It is easy when a prisoner has been arrested and brought to the dock
to give details of his complexion, height, characteristics and
identifying marks, to fingerprint him and to photograph him, but how
inadequate was the description before his capture, how frequently did
false scents draw the pursuer off the right track! It is with this in
mind that we examine the subject of this investigation, remembering
that it has not been done before in detail. And, to complete the case,
the book has been photographed in its entirety and its facsimile
herewith published.</p>
<p>In studying the Doctrina Christiana of 1593 there are four general
problems which we shall discuss. First, we shall give a physical
description of the book. Secondly, we shall trace chronologically the
bibliographical history of the Doctrina, that is, we shall record the
available evidence which shows that it was the first book printed in
the Philippines, and weigh the testimonies which state or imply to the
contrary. Thirdly, we shall try to establish the authorship of the
text, and lastly, we shall discuss the actual printing.</p>
<p>It hardly needs be told why so few of the incunabula of the
Philippines have survived. The paper on which they were printed was one
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e145" href="#xd25e145" name=
"xd25e145">2</a>]</span>the most destructible papers ever used in book
production. The native worms and insects thrived on it, and the heat
and dampness took their slower but equally certain toll. Add to these
enemies the acts of providence of which the Philippines have received
more than their share&mdash;earthquake, fire and flood&mdash;and the
man-made devastations of war, combined with the fact that there was no
systematic attempt made in the Philippines to preserve in archives and
libraries the records of the past, and it can well be understood why a
scant handful of cradle-books have been preserved. The two fires of
1603 alone, which burned the Dominican convent in Manila to the ground
and consumed the whole of Binondo just outside the walls, must have
played untold havoc upon the records of the early missionaries. Perhaps
the only copies of early Philippine books which exist today,
unchronicled and forgotten, are those which were sent to Europe in the
16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and may now be lying uncatalogued in
some library there.</p>
<p>One copy of this Doctrina was sent to Philip&nbsp;II by the Governor
of the Philippines in 1593; and in 1785 a Jesuit philologist, Hervas y
Panduro, printed Tagalog texts from a then extant copy. Yet, since that
time no example is recorded as having been seen by bibliographer or
historian. The provenance of the present one is but imperfectly known.
In the spring of 1946 William H. Schab, a New York dealer, was in
Paris, and heard through a friend of the existence of a 1593 Manila
book. He expressed such incredulity at this information that his
friend, feeling his integrity impugned, telephoned the owner then and
there, and confirmed the unbelievable &ldquo;1593.&rdquo; Delighted and
enthused, Schab arranged to meet him, found that he was a Paris
bookseller and collector who specialized in Pacific imprints and was
fully aware of the importance of the volume, and induced him to sell
the precious Doctrina. He brought it back with him to the United States
and offered it to Lessing J. Rosenwald, who promptly purchased it and
presented it to the Library of Congress. Where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e149" href="#xd25e149" name=
"xd25e149">3</a>]</span>the book had been before it reached Paris we do
not know. Perhaps it is the very copy sent to Philip&nbsp;II, perhaps
the copy from which Hervas got his text. Indeed, it may have been
churned to the surface by the late Civil War in Spain, and sent from
there to France. In the course of years from similar sources may come
other books to throw more light upon the only too poorly documented
history of the establishment of printing in the Philippine Islands.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us first examine the book as it appears before us.
The title-page reads:</p>
<div class="figure titlewidth"><img src="images/title.gif" alt=""
width="479" height="283"></div>
<p>The book, printed in Gothic letters and Tagalog<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e161src" href="#xd25e161" name="xd25e161src">1</a> characters
on paper made from the paper mulberry, now browned and brittle with
age, consists of thirty-eight leaves, comprising a title-page as above,
under a woodcut<a class="noteref" id="xd25e170src" href="#xd25e170"
name="xd25e170src">2</a> of St. Dominic, with the verso originally
blank, but in this copy bearing the contemporary manuscript
inscription, <i lang="es">Tassada en dos rreales</i>, signed <i>Juan de
Cuellar</i>; and seventy-four pages of text in Spanish, Tagalog
transliterated into roman letters, and Tagalog in Tagalog characters.
The size of the volume, which is unbound, is 9&#8539; by 7 inches,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e179" href="#xd25e179" name=
"xd25e179">4</a>]</span>although individual leaves vary somewhat due to
chipping. Some of the leaves have become separated from their
complements, but enough remain in the original stitching to indicate
that the book was originally made up in four gatherings, the first of
twelve leaves, the second of ten, the third of ten, and the fourth of
six. Although the book is of the size called quarto, the method of
printing must have been page by page, so it is doubtful that each sheet
was folded twice in the usual quarto manner, but more probable that it
was printed four pages to a sheet of paper approximately 9&#8539; by 14
inches, which was folded once.</p>
<p>The volume is printed throughout by the xylographic method, that is
to say, each page of text is printed from one wood-block which was
carved by hand. Along the inner margins of some pages are vertical
lines which were made by the inked edge of the block, and the grain of
the wood has caused striations to appear in the printed portions
throughout. The unevenness of the impression indicates that the pages
were printed in some primitive manner without the help of a
conventional press.</p>
<p>The paper, which is one of the distinctive features of most old
Oriental books, has been discussed at length by Pardo de Tavera in his
study of early Philippine printing, and we can do no better than
translate the relevant passage in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I have said before that the material
composition of our books is inferior. The imprints before 1830 were
made on a paper called by some rice paper, by others silk paper, and by
still others China paper, according to their taste. It is detestable,
brittle, without consistency or resistance, and was called rice paper
because it was supposed to be made from that grain. It was the only
kind then used in the Philippines, not only for printing, but for all
manner of writing, letters, etc., and it is even recorded that in 1874
when tobacco was a state monopoly, cigarettes were made with this
paper, and that the Indians and Chinese preferred it (and perhaps they
still do) to rag paper or other kinds, because of the horrible taste it
gives the tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In China they commonly made paper of bamboo, but more
principally from cotton and a plant which travellers have cited only by
its common name, which they transcribe in various ways, calling it
<i>kochu</i>, <i>kotsu</i>, or <i>kotzu</i>. Today it is known that
this plant is an ulmacea (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>) from a mash
of which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e202" href="#xd25e202"
name="xd25e202">5</a>]</span>still make cloth in Japan. Cotton paper is
superior to it, and naturally more expensive; but the paper of inferior
quality which was received in Manila, where nothing was imported
regularly but common articles of low price, was of <i>kotsu.</i> As all
Chinese-made paper it was coated with alum, the finer [the paper] the
thicker [the coating], for the purpose of whitening it and making the
surface smooth, a deplorable business, for it made the paper very
moisture absorbent, a condition fatal in such a humid climate as in
these islands. Moreover, as the alum used is impure and contains a
large proportion of iron salts, the humidity and weather oxidize it
which finally darkens the paper, so that Philippine books present a
coloration which runs the gamut of tones from the color of bone to that
of dark cinnamon.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e208src" href=
"#xd25e208" name="xd25e208src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the Doctrina Christiana, which may well be translated
&ldquo;The Teachings of Christianity,&rdquo; contains the basic
elements of the religion which the missionaries were trying to spread
among the unbaptized in the remote regions of the world, it was the
most useful handbook they had. A summary of the contents of the present
edition shows the fundamental character of the work. After a syllabary
comes the Pater Noster, the primary and most popular prayer of
Christianity. Then follow the Ave Maria, Credo, Salve Regina, Articles
of Faith, Ten Commandments, Commandments of the Holy Church, Sacraments
of the Holy Church, Seven Mortal Sins, Fourteen Works of Charity,
Confession and Catechism. Here in a small compass is presented the
simplest, most easily learned and most essential tenets of the Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>So useful was the Doctrina considered as a guide for those who had
just been, or were about to be, converted that the missionary fathers
placed it in most cases foremost among the books necessary to have in
print in a strange land. It is generally accepted today, although no
extant copy is known, that the first book printed in Mexico<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e224src" href="#xd25e224" name="xd25e224src">4</a> in
1539 was a Doctrina in Mexican and Spanish. Recent research has shown
that the second book printed by the pioneer Jesuit press at Goa, in
India, in 1557 was St. Francis Xavier&rsquo;s <i lang="pt">Doutrina
Christ&atilde;o</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e235src" href="#xd25e235"
name="xd25e235src">5</a> in the Malay language, of which also no copy
has yet been located. But there are copies of the first book to come
from a South American press, another Doctrina<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e241src" href="#xd25e241" name="xd25e241src">6</a> printed in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e247" href="#xd25e247" name=
"xd25e247">6</a>]</span>the native and Spanish languages at Lima in
1584. So the choice of this book as the first to be printed at Manila
follows a widespread precedent.</p>
<p>We have then a book, the Doctrina Christiana, in Spanish and
Tagalog, corrected by priests of more than one order&mdash;and this is
important in tracing the authorship of the work&mdash;and printed by
the xylographic method with license at Manila at the Dominican Church
of San Gabriel in 1593. So much we get from the title, and in itself it
is a fairly complete story, but from the date of its issue until the
present time that very fundamental information has not been completely
recorded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Bibliographical History</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In tracing our clues down through the years, we find
at the very beginning the most valuable evidence which has been
uncovered, short of the book itself. From Manila on June 20, 1593, the
Governor of the Philippines, Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, wrote a
letter to Philip&nbsp;II of Spain in which he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Sire, in the name of Your Majesty, I have for
this once, because of the existing great need, granted a license for
the printing of the Doctrinas Christianas, herewith enclosed&mdash;one
in the Tagalog language, which is the native and best of these islands,
and the other in Chinese&mdash;from which I hope great benefits will
result in the conversion and instruction of the peoples of both
nations; and because the lands of the Indies are on a larger scale in
everything and things more expensive, I have set the price of them at
four reales a piece, until Your Majesty is pleased to decree in full
what is to be done.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e259src" href=
"#xd25e259" name="xd25e259src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This states unequivocally that two books were printed at Manila some
time before June 20, 1593, one of which was the Doctrina in Tagalog,
and the other the same work in Chinese. Although we are chiefly
concerned here with the former, the fact that they were produced at
about the same time and probably at the same place makes it necessary
to trace the history of both in order to reconstruct the circumstances
surrounding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e270" href="#xd25e270"
name="xd25e270">7</a>]</span>the production of the one. Of the Chinese
Doctrina no copy has yet come to light, and except for two 1593
references, there are no records of its existence.</p>
<p>Another document<a class="noteref" id="xd25e274src" href="#xd25e274"
name="xd25e274src">8</a> of 1593 verifies the information given in the
letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as, differing from it only in one detail. In
the Archives of the Indies was found a manuscript account of 1593
listing books written in the Philippines, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;There have been printed primers and catechisms
of the faith, one in Spanish and Tagalog, which is the native language,
and the other in Chinese, which are being sent to Your Majesty, the
Tagalog priced at two reales and the Chinese at four, which is hoped
will be of great benefit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accounts of the printing of two Doctrinas contained in these
documents confirm some of the information of the title and add a bit
more. First, the letter says that the book was printed by permission
given by the Governor, which agrees with the &ldquo;with license&rdquo;
of the title, &ldquo;for this once because of the existing great
need.&rdquo; By a royal cedula<a class="noteref" id="xd25e294src" href=
"#xd25e294" name="xd25e294src">9</a> of September 21, 1556, which was
promulgated again on August 14, 1560, it had been ordered that Justices
&ldquo;not consent to or permit to be printed or sold any book
containing material concerning the Indies without having special
license sent by our Royal Council of the Indies,&rdquo; and on May 8,
1584 this was implemented by the further order &ldquo;that when any
grammar or dictionary of the language of the Indies be made it shall
not be published, or printed or used unless it has first been examined
by the Bishop and seen by the Royal Audiencia.&rdquo; This latter
portion was applied specifically to the Philippines in a
letter<a class="noteref" id="xd25e299src" href="#xd25e299" name=
"xd25e299src">10</a> from Philip&nbsp;II to the Audiencia of Manila,
also dated May 8, 1584, to which further reference will be made. It can
be gathered from Dasmari&ntilde;as&rsquo; implied apology that he had
never before given such a license, and, since he had arrived in the
Philippines in 1590, that no books had been printed between that time
and the licensing of the Doctrinas. It is, moreover, likely that if any
similar books had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e305" href=
"#xd25e305" name="xd25e305">8</a>]</span>printed during the
administrations of his predecessors he would have mentioned the fact as
a precedent for acting contrary to the cedulas.</p>
<p>According to Dasmari&ntilde;as he had priced the books at four
reales a piece, which followed the regular Spanish procedure, under
which books were subject to price control. The Governor, it will be
noted, also apologized for the high price he was forced to set, giving
general high prices<a class="noteref" id="xd25e309src" href="#xd25e309"
name="xd25e309src">11</a> as his excuse. Yet, while the appraisal of
four reales for this book was high compared to the prevailing scale in
Spain, it was not high compared to prices allowed in Mexico. On June 6,
1542 the Emperor had given the Casa de Cromberger, the first
printing-house in Mexico, permission<a class="noteref" id="xd25e315src"
href="#xd25e315" name="xd25e315src">12</a> to sell books printed there
at seventeen maraved&iacute;s a sheet, or exactly one half a real. If
we assume that, although the Doctrina had been printed page by page, it
was quarto in size and so appraised on the basis of eight pages to a
sheet, we find that the price per sheet comes to about fourteen
maraved&iacute;s, or less than half a real. However, a contradiction
occurs between the letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as and this copy of the
Doctrina, supported by the other 1593 document. On the verso of the
title, Juan de Cuellar,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e330src" href=
"#xd25e330" name="xd25e330src">13</a> the Governor&rsquo;s secretary
and the logical person to sign the official valuation, gives the price
as two reales, and the 1593 account, while agreeing with the letter as
far as the Chinese Doctrina is concerned, also lists the price of the
Tagalog Doctrina as two reales. It is impossible to say what caused the
discrepancy; perhaps it was a decision on Dasmari&ntilde;as&rsquo; part
to lower the cost, notwithstanding inflationary values, in order to
make the book more readily available for the natives who were not
economically as well off as the Chinese, or it could be that after the
letter had been written it was noticed that the Chinese volume was
larger than the Tagalog one, and some adjustment made. In any event,
the price of this Doctrina was finally set at two reales, making it
less than half the price allowed in Mexico fifty years before.</p>
<p>The evidence of the two 1593 documents would seem conclusive
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e341" href="#xd25e341" name=
"xd25e341">9</a>]</span>with regard to printing in 1593, but witnesses
were not long in appearing who stated something quite different. The
earliest of these was Pedro Chirino,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e343src"
href="#xd25e343" name="xd25e343src">14</a> a Jesuit priest, who came to
the Philippines with Dasmari&ntilde;as in 1590. He went back to Europe
in 1602, and while there had a history of the Philippines printed at
Rome in 1604. In 1606 he returned to the islands, where he died in
1635. He left unpublished the manuscript of another and more detailed
history, dated 1610, which contains a most significant passage, where,
after speaking of various early writers in native languages, he
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Those who printed first were; P. Fr. Juan de
Villanueva of the Order of St. Augustine [who printed] certain little
tracts, and P. Fr. Francisco de San Joseph of the Order of St. Dominic
[who printed] larger things of more bulk.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e349src" href="#xd25e349" name="xd25e349src">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning this Juan de Villanueva<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e357src" href="#xd25e357" name="xd25e357src">16</a> very little
indeed is known. From what has been recorded it would seem that there
were two Augustinians of the same name who were in the Philippines
before 1600. The first of these was a secular priest who came to
Ceb&uacute; about 1566, may have taken the Augustinian habit some time
after his arrival, and died not long after 1569. The other Juan de
Villanueva, the date of whose arrival is unknown, was in Lubao in 1590,
in Hagonoy in 1593, and prior of Batangas from 1596 until his death in
1599. Of the two there can be no doubt but that Chirino referred to the
second one. But, apart from Chirino&rsquo;s note, there is no record
anywhere that works by him existed, nor do the Augustinian chroniclers
themselves, except for the modern Santiago Vela who knew of
Chirino&rsquo;s citation, mention him as a linguist or a writer. The
only possibility is that between 1593 and 1599 Villanueva had printed
some small xylographic books no copies and no further record of which
have appeared.</p>
<p>As for Francisco de San Joseph, or Blancas de San Jos&eacute; as he
is more frequently called, there are other references to his part in
the establishment of printing in the islands. From information
doubtless obtained from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e365" href=
"#xd25e365" name="xd25e365">10</a>]</span>Diego Aduarte, then in Spain,
Alonso Fernandez wrote in his ecclesiastical history, printed at Toledo
in 1611:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Father Fr. Francisco Blancas printed in the
Tagalog language and characters a book of Our Lady of the Rosary in the
year 1602, which was the first book that was printed there of that or
any other material. After this he printed another of the sacraments in
the language of the Philippines, in both characters, theirs and ours,
from which the greatest results have been achieved.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e370src" href="#xd25e370" name=
"xd25e370src">17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two years later the same author published at Madrid an
account<a class="noteref" id="xd25e390src" href="#xd25e390" name=
"xd25e390src">18</a> of the miracles performed by the Rosary of the
Virgin, in which he included a list of &ldquo;Of some writers of the
Order of St. Dominic who were living in this year 1612,&rdquo; and gave
the same information as above, adding only that the printing took place
in Bataan.</p>
<p>Diego Aduarte,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e404src" href="#xd25e404"
name="xd25e404src">19</a> whose history of the Dominican province of
the Philippines is one of the best contemporary ones written, bears out
these statements of which he was most probably the source. Aduarte came
to the islands in company with his close friend Blancas de San
Jos&eacute; in 1595, went back to Spain as procurator of his order in
1607, and returned to Manila in 1628, staying in the Orient until his
death in 1636. His history was continued and edited after his death by
a fellow Dominican, Domingo Gon&ccedil;alez, who had it printed in
1640. Summarizing the life and accomplishments of Blancas de San
Jos&eacute;, Aduarte wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;So he was sent to Bataan, which is near there
[Manila], where he learned the language of the Indians, called Tagalog,
which is the most common in this country and is used among the Indians
for many leagues around the city. So rapid was his study of the
language that he began to preach in it within three months, and could
teach it to others in six&#8202;&hellip;. And believing that he was the
instrument needed to bring the holy gospel to the Indians, he spared no
pains to investigate the fitness of their words, the way to use them,
and all the rest so that he could succeed in mastering
it&#8202;&hellip;. He wrote many books of devotion for them, and since
there was no printing in these islands, and no one who understood it or
who was a journeyman printer, he planned to have it done through a
Chinaman, a good Christian, who, seeing that the books of P. Fr.
Francisco were sure to be of great use, bestowed so much care upon this
undertaking that he finally succeeded, aided by those who told him
whatever they knew about it, in learning everything necessary to do
printing; and he printed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e413" href=
"#xd25e413" name="xd25e413">11</a>]</span>these books. . . . He
[Blancas de San Jos&eacute;] printed a grammar to learn the Tagalog
language, a memorial of the Christian life, a book on the four last
things, another on the preparation for the communion, a confessionary,
another on the mysteries of the Rosary of Our Lady, and another to
teach the Tagalog Indians the Spanish language, and he left many very
pious and curious works in the language of these
Indians.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e415src" href="#xd25e415"
name="xd25e415src">20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blancas de San Jos&eacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e421src" href=
"#xd25e421" name="xd25e421src">21</a> as we have noted, came to the
Philippines in 1595. He was at Abucay in Bataan from 1598 until 1602,
and then spent several years in and about Manila, preaching to the
Indians and the Chinese, whose language he also mastered. In 1614 he
set out for Spain, but died on the voyage before reaching Mexico. Of
the books which he is said to have had printed, only two are known to
be extant, the <i lang="es">Arte y Reglas de la Lengva
Tagala</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e432src" href="#xd25e432" name=
"xd25e432src">22</a> and the <i lang="tl">Librong Pagaaralan nang manga
Tagalog nang uicang Castilla</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e440src"
href="#xd25e440" name="xd25e440src">23</a> (or <i lang="es">Libro en
qve aprendan los Tagalos, la lengua Castellana</i>), both printed at
Bataan in 1610, and until the discovery of the present Doctrina and the
<i lang="es">Ordinationes</i> of 1604 the earliest surviving Philippine
imprints known.</p>
<p>We have not cited here in detail the account of Juan Lopez<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e452src" href="#xd25e452" name="xd25e452src">24</a>
in the fifth part of his history of the Dominicans, because, although
it was printed nineteen years before the appearance of Aduarte&rsquo;s
work, the information therein contained regarding the Philippines was
acknowledgedly obtained from the unfinished manuscript which Aduarte
had with him in Spain. The pertinent passages add nothing to
Aduarte&rsquo;s information, and even the wording is reminiscent of
his.</p>
<p>The first suggestion that early Philippine books may have been
printed from wood-blocks occurred in Qu&eacute;tif and Echard&rsquo;s
bibliography of Dominican writers printed at Paris in 1719. There,
after listing eight works by Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, they add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;He published all these in the Philippines with
the help of a Chinese Christian using Chinese blocks, for in his day
European typographers had not yet arrived in those islands, nor did
they have types for their language.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e463src" href="#xd25e463" name="xd25e463src">25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e475" href="#xd25e475" name=
"xd25e475">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>This was an amazing suggestion, for as far as we know the
bibliographers who made it had not actually seen the books; nor is it
entirely true. The first two works listed are two books we know were
printed typographically in 1610. The sixth is <i lang="es">De los
mysterios del Rosario de nuestra Se&ntilde;ora Tagalice</i>, the book
referred to by Fern&aacute;ndez as having been printed in 1602, and
generally accepted as being from movable type, although no copy has
been discovered to prove it. And yet, it is not at all impossible that
some time before 1602 Blancas de San Jos&eacute; had some of his
writings printed from blocks. In any event, the idea, later developed
by Medina and Retana, that xylography was used before a real
printing-press was established, may have come from this not wholly
accurate note.</p>
<p>For almost a hundred and fifty years no historian or bibliographer
wrote anything to challenge the basic affirmations of Chirino,
Fern&aacute;ndez and Aduarte. In the middle of the 18th century,
Lorenzo Hervas y Panduro,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e483src" href=
"#xd25e483" name="xd25e483src">26</a> a Jesuit, was forced by the
expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain to seek refuge in the Papal States,
and took up residence at Cesena. There he began work on a tremendous
universal history of the spiritual development of man, into which he
wove the results of his philosophical, social and linguistic studies.
These last were of particular importance, and Hervas is regarded as the
true founder of the science of linguistics and comparative philology.
In 1785 he published the eighteenth volume of his massive work, the
<i lang="it">Origine, formazione, meccanismo, ed armonia degl&rsquo;
idiomi</i>, in which he printed a Tagalog Ave Maria as written in 1593,
with the note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Ave Maria in the Tagalog of 1593 is to be
read in the Tagalog-Spanish Doctrina Christiana which was printed in
Tagalog and roman characters by the Dominican fathers in their
printing-house at Manila in the year 1593.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e492src" href="#xd25e492" name="xd25e492src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1787 he finished his twenty-first volume, <i lang="it">Saggio
pratico</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e503src" href="#xd25e503" name=
"xd25e503src">28</a> which was another philological study, including
the Pater Noster in over three hundred languages and dialects, among
them Tagalog, again from the 1593 Doctrina. Here, then, is ample proof
that a copy of this book was known <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e509" href="#xd25e509" name="xd25e509">13</a>]</span>to Hervas in
1785, and the only information which his loose transcription of the
title failed to give was that the volume was &ldquo;corrected by
members of the orders,&rdquo; that it was printed with license, and
that it was printed at San Gabriel.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the following century two German scholars,
familiar with Hervas&rsquo; writings, noted the 1593 Doctrina. Franz
Carl Alter,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e513src" href="#xd25e513" name=
"xd25e513src">29</a> in his monograph on the Tagalog language, printed
the Ave Maria from the text which had appeared in 1785, and Johann
Christoph Adelung,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e519src" href="#xd25e519"
name="xd25e519src">30</a> in his <i lang="de">Mithridates</i>, a
comprehensive study of languages, included the Tagalog Pater Noster
from the <i lang="it">Saggio pratico</i> of 1787. The latter also
listed in a short bibliography of the Tagalog language the Doctrina of
1593, giving exactly the same information about it that Hervas had.
Neither of these men apparently saw a copy of the book, limiting
themselves to extracts from Hervas, but they perpetuated an earlier
reference of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Shortly after the two Germans published their notices of the 1593
Doctrina an entry appeared of a book printed at Manila in 1581.
Jos&eacute; Mariano Beristain y Sousa, a learned Mexican writer, issued
in 1819&ndash;21 a bibliography of Spanish-American books, in which he
listed alphabetically the authors, giving a short biography of each and
adding a list of his works. Under Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones we find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Arte y Vocabulario de la Lengua
Tagala,&rsquo; Imp. en Manila, 1581.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e536src" href="#xd25e536" name="xd25e536src">31</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No specific authority is given for this entry, but in his sketch of
the life of Qui&ntilde;ones Beristain cited as sources, Juan de
Grijalva, Nicol&aacute;s Antonio, Gaspar de San Agustin, and
Jos&eacute; Sicardo. It would seem logical that one of these must have
mentioned such a work as printed in Manila in 1581, but in tracing down
the sources no such precise notice is found.</p>
<p>Grijalva simply said that Qui&ntilde;ones &ldquo;concerned himself
with Tagalog and made a vocabulary and grammar of it.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e546src" href="#xd25e546" name="xd25e546src">32</a>
Antonio<a class="noteref" id="xd25e552src" href="#xd25e552" name=
"xd25e552src">33</a> referred to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e558" href="#xd25e558" name="xd25e558">14</a>]</span>Grijalva, and
carried the matter no further. San Agustin, describing the Franciscan
chapter of 1578, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It was determined moreover in this chapter that
P. Fr. Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones, prior of the Convent of Taal in
Tagalos, and Fr. Diego de Ochoa, prior of Bacolor in Pampanga, should
compose and fashion grammars, dictionaries, and confessionaries in the
two languages [respectively Tagalog and Pampanga] in which they had
ventured; which they executed very promptly and well, and these were of
great use to those who came to these islands, for they had these by
which they could study the languages.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e563src" href="#xd25e563" name="xd25e563src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, San Agustin, again mentioning Qui&ntilde;ones, referred to
Grijalva, and added as an additional source for his information
T&oacute;mas de Herrera. Sicardo<a class="noteref" id="xd25e568src"
href="#xd25e568" name="xd25e568src">35</a> added nothing new. Herrera,
not cited directly by Beristain, may however have been the source from
which the &ldquo;Imp.&rdquo; of his entry came. Herrera wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;He [Qui&ntilde;ones] was the first to have
learned the Tagalog language of which he published a grammar and
dictionary as an aid to the ministers of the gospel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Beristain read this, he may have been misled by the Latin of
&ldquo;published,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e584src" href=
"#xd25e584" name="xd25e584src">36</a> <i lang="la">in lucem edidit</i>,
which may indeed mean printed and published, but also means quite
properly published in the sense of written in manuscript and copied and
circulated. We agree with Schilling<a class="noteref" id="xd25e593src"
href="#xd25e593" name="xd25e593src">37</a> that this latter meaning was
the one intended. One other statement that Qui&ntilde;ones&rsquo; works
were printed may derive from the same misunderstanding. About the year
1801 Pedro Bello wrote an account, still in manuscript and unpublished,
of the writings of the Augustinians. His remarks on Qui&ntilde;ones,
first printed by Santiago Vela<a class="noteref" id="xd25e596src" href=
"#xd25e596" name="xd25e596src">38</a>, we believe are only an extension
of Herrera&rsquo;s <i lang="la">in lucem edidit</i>.</p>
<p>This same confusion in terminology has been used<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e607src" href="#xd25e607" name="xd25e607src">39</a> to support
Beristain&rsquo;s claim by introducing as evidence the letter of
Philip&nbsp;II of May 8, 1584. Salazar, the Bishop of Manila, probably
shortly after the Synod of 1582, had written the King a letter, now
unfortunately lost, in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e610"
href="#xd25e610" name="xd25e610">15</a>]</span>he spoke of a decision
to standardize linguistic works. In answer to the Bishop, the following
letter in the form of a royal cedula was sent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;To the President and Judges of my Royal
Audiencia situated in the city of Manila in the Philippine
Islands.&mdash;It has been told me on behalf of Don Fray Domingo de
Salazar, Bishop of that place, that it was agreed that no priest might
make a grammar or vocabulary, and that if it were made it might not be
published before being examined and approved by the said Bishop,
because otherwise there would result great differences and
disagreements in the doctrine; and this having been seen by my Council
of the Indies, it was agreed that I should order this my cedula which
decrees that when any grammar or vocabulary be made it shall not be
published or used unless it has first been examined by the said Bishop
and seen by this Audencia.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e615src"
href="#xd25e615" name="xd25e615src">40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again the word <i lang="es">publicado</i> is brought forth to
prove that the letter referred to printed works, but here again the
term is equally applicable to manuscript works in common use and
generally available.</p>
<p>Further evidence that there was no printing as early as 1581 is to
be found in a letter<a class="noteref" id="xd25e637src" href=
"#xd25e637" name="xd25e637src">41</a> from Juan de Plasencia, a
Tagalist of great renown, to the King, dated from Manila, June 18,
1585, in which he reported on the state of missionary work in China and
Japan, and added that he had written a grammar and a declaration of the
whole Doctrina in the most common language of the Philippines, and that
he was then making a dictionary, concluding by asking the King to send
decrees ordering those works to be printed in Mexico at the expense of
the Exchequer. Is it likely that Plasencia would have so written if an
<i lang="es">Arte y Vocabulario</i> had been printed four years
earlier? Furthermore, San Antonio, recording the book on the customs
and rites of the Indians written by Plasencia at the request of the
Governor Santiago de Vera, and dated October 24, 1589, said that it was
not printed &ldquo;because printing houses had not yet come to this
country.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e643src" href="#xd25e643"
name="xd25e643src">42</a></p>
<p>We then conclude with regard to Beristain&rsquo;s entry, that
although there existed in manuscript an <i lang="es">Arte y Vocabuldrio
Tagalo</i> by Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones, there is no evidence of the
existence of any book printed for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e651" href="#xd25e651" name="xd25e651">16</a>]</span>him from
wood-blocks or in type. Santiago de Vela<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e653src" href="#xd25e653" name="xd25e653src">43</a> suggests the
possibility that there might have been a xylographic <i lang=
"es">Arte</i> of 1581, but Schilling<a class="noteref" id="xd25e662src"
href="#xd25e662" name="xd25e662src">44</a> questions this in the face
of the complete lack of reference to such a printed work by any 17th or
18th century writer, and the tenuous notices of Bello and Beristain;
yet to say categorically that no such work was printed would be
foolhardy in the face of the scanty early records and the appearance of
this Doctrina, a single copy of which has just been discovered.</p>
<p>The first important work devoted solely to the early history of the
Philippine press was by T.H. Pardo de Tavera, who in 1893 published his
study of printing and engraving in the Philippines. He there recorded a
1593 Doctrina, but adamantly refused to accept it on the hearsay
evidence of others. His account is valuable because it shows that there
may have been a copy of the Doctrina in Java in 1885, and so we quote
from it at some length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A learned Dutch orientalist, Dr. J. Brandes,
wrote me in 1885 from Bali-Boeleleng (Java) telling me that in 1593 at
Manila there was printed a Doctrina Christiana in Spanish-Tagalog, with
the proper characters for the latter language. Other orientalists, at
the last Congress in London in 1891, gave me the same information.
Nonetheless, no one told me where he had read such a thing, nor much
less that he had managed to see such a book, although inspecting a rare
book which I acquired in Paris (Alter, <i lang="de">Ueber die
tagalische sprache</i>, Vienna, 1803), I saw that the author cited such
a Doctrina Christiana and said that he knew of its existence through
Abb&eacute; Hervas. This is an error, and without doubt such a Doctrina
was in manuscript, because in 1591 [he should have said 1593] there was
no press in Manila nor in any part of the archipelago, and today we
know for certain and positively that the first book issued there
appeared in 1610.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e673src" href=
"#xd25e673" name="xd25e673src">45</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pardo de Tavera was the first to call attention to Alter, and
through him to Hervas, and in all probability the orientalists at the
London Congress had seen the Doctrina cited by one of these or Adelung.
But he rejects that evidence in no uncertain terms. Mitigating somewhat
his assurance, he speaks following the above-quoted passage of printing
in China, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e681" href="#xd25e681"
name="xd25e681">17</a>]</span>differentiates between xylographic and
typographic printing, and since he was obviously thinking in terms of
printing on a press with movable type his conclusions are not too
extreme.</p>
<p>In 1896 appeared Jos&eacute; Toribio Medina&rsquo;s <i lang="es">La
Imprenta en Manila</i>, which was up to then the best, most complete
and most scholarly work on early Philippine printing, and is today with
its subsequent additions and corrections the standard bibliography of
the subject. There Medina cited most of the authorities we have already
quoted, the letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as, Fern&aacute;ndez&rsquo;
<i lang="es">Historia eclesiastica</i>, Aduarte, Adelung, Beristain and
Pardo de Tavera. Then, basing his conclusions strongly on the
Dasmari&ntilde;as letter and the note of Adelung, he listed<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e691src" href="#xd25e691" name="xd25e691src">46</a>
as number one in his bibliography the Doctrina of 1593 in Spanish and
Tagalog, and as number two the Doctrina in Spanish and Chinese of the
same year. This is a verdict which has stood the test of time, and one
that is just now confirmed by the discovery of the book itself. Two
points, however, in his survey should be noted. In his discussion of
the printing and the authorship Medina does not emphasize the Dominican
origin of the book, although he does say that &ldquo;it does not appear
bold to us to suppose that the imprint of these Doctrinas ought to be
the Hospital of San Gabriel in this village [Binondo],&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e694src" href="#xd25e694" name="xd25e694src">47</a>
and faithfully copies Adelung&rsquo;s imprint notice, &ldquo;in the
Dominican printing-house,&rdquo; in his listing of the book. The other
point is that he says in his introduction and repeats in his entry that
the Doctrina had a Latin as well as Spanish and Tagalog texts, an
erroneous translation of Adelung&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang="de">mit
lateinische und tagalische Schrift</span>.&rdquo; He was hesitant as
are all bibliographers, who must perforce record the probable existence
of a book a copy of which they have never seen, in committing himself
as to whether it was printed from blocks or from type or by a
combination of the two methods.</p>
<p>More positive and more succinct than Medina was T.E. Retana whose
earlier researches<a class="noteref" id="xd25e702src" href="#xd25e702"
name="xd25e702src">48</a> into the history of the Philippines Medina
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e714" href="#xd25e714" name=
"xd25e714">18</a>]</span>acknowledgedly made use of, and who in 1897
published his <i lang="es">La Imprenta en Filipinas, Adiciones y
Observaciones a La Imprenta en Manila</i>. He took the material of
Medina, added the evidence of Chirino and Plasencia, and resummarized
the problem. The letter of Dasmari&ntilde;as showed conclusively that a
Doctrina was printed in 1593. Chirino said that the first two whose
works were printed were Juan de Villanueva and Blancas de San
Jos&eacute;. Fern&aacute;ndez stated positively that the first book
printed in the Philippines was the book of Our Lady of the Rosary by
Blancas de San Jos&eacute; printed at Bataan in 1602. Aduarte supported
this without mentioning a title, place or date of printing. If we are
to accept all these statements as incontrovertible, how can the
apparent contradictions be reconciled? The answer had already been
hinted at, but Retana solved the problem with amazing acumen, and
arrived at four conclusions, which are here printed in his own
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A&mdash;That the Doctrinas of 1593, though
printed at Manila, were not executed in type, but by the so-called
xylographic method;</p>
<p>B&mdash;That the initiative for the establishment of
<i>typography</i> is owed to P. Fr. Francisco Blancas de San
Jos&eacute;;</p>
<p>C&mdash;That the first <i>typographer</i> was the Chinese Christian
Juan de Vera at the instigation of the said Father San Jos&eacute;;</p>
<p>D&mdash;That the first <i>typographical</i> printing of this
Dominican author is of the year 1602.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e737src" href="#xd25e737" name="xd25e737src">49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not difficult to say with the book itself in front of us, that
it is an example of xylographic printing, but it was a great feat on
the part of Retana, who had never seen a copy, to resolve apparently
irreconcilable differences of opinion on the part of several
unquestioned authorities by deducing that it was all a matter of
semantics&mdash;what did <i>printing</i> mean? As for the sprite of
1581 introduced by Beristain, Retana dismissed it on the grounds of
insufficient evidence. In a word, he concluded that the first book
issued in the Philippines was a Doctrina printed from wood-blocks in
1593. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e745" href="#xd25e745" name=
"xd25e745">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>All subsequent writers on the subject have derived their information
from the sources we have already mentioned, and to a great degree have
been influenced by the findings of Medina and Retana. The Rev. Thomas
Cooke Middleton<a class="noteref" id="xd25e748src" href="#xd25e748"
name="xd25e748src">50</a> in 1900 confessed that he did not know what
the first book printed was. Pardo de Tavera maintained his old
<span class="corr" id="xd25e754" title=
"Source: intransigeance">intransigence</span>, when in the introduction
to his bibliography for the Library of Congress in 1903 he wrote that
Medina&rsquo;s affirmation that printing took place in 1593
&ldquo;loses all validity in the face of the categorical statement of
F. Alonso Fern&aacute;ndez.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e757src"
href="#xd25e757" name="xd25e757src">51</a> Medina did not comment
further in his <i lang="es">Adiciones y Ampliaciones</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e765src" href="#xd25e765" name="xd25e765src">52</a>
of 1904, yet when the same year P&eacute;rez and G&uuml;emes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e771src" href="#xd25e771" name="xd25e771src">53</a>
published their additions to and continuation of Medina, bringing his
bibliography down to 1850, they resurrected the 1581 <i lang=
"es">Arte</i>, but added no new evidence to prove their case. Blair and
Robertson, in their tremendous, collective history of the Philippines,
did not include a list of Philippine imprints in their
bibliography,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e778src" href="#xd25e778" name=
"xd25e778src">54</a> but referred readers to Medina and Retana with
whom they agreed. To celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of
typographical printing in the Philippines Artigas y Cuerva<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e781src" href="#xd25e781" name="xd25e781src">55</a>
wrote a study which emphasized the part played by Blancas de San
Jos&eacute;, but did not deny the existence of the 1593 Doctrina.
Retana<a class="noteref" id="xd25e787src" href="#xd25e787" name=
"xd25e787src">56</a> in 1911 brought his work on the subject up to
date, but retained all his major conclusions. In Palau&rsquo;s standard
bibliography of Spanish books we find the Doctrinas called &ldquo;the
two earliest books known to have been printed in
Manila.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e796src" href="#xd25e796"
name="xd25e796src">57</a> Finally, the most thorough recent work on the
subject is to be found in Schilling&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e802src" href="#xd25e802" name="xd25e802src">58</a> survey of the
early history of the Philippine press published in 1937. There is
little that can be added to the evidence uncovered by these modern
writers, but the appearance of the book itself enables us to say with
certainty some things which they were able only to surmise. However, as
regards the authorship and the circumstances and place of printing we
are able, from the information given on the title, to carry the
investigation somewhat further. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e808"

<h3 class="main">The Authorship of the Text</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The title tells us that the book was
&ldquo;corrected&rdquo; by the priests of more than one order, and
since it was printed by the Dominicans, we can assume that the ultimate
responsibility for the preparation of the text in consultation with
friars of other orders also lay in their hands. Our problem then is to
discover what texts were available to them in 1593 and who were the
priests who formed the editorial board. We have included in this study
also the origins of the Chinese text, for the two Doctrinas appeared at
the same time, and as we shall see the same Dominicans were probably
responsible for the production and preparation of both the Tagalog and
the Chinese texts. During the period under discussion there were
priests of four orders active in the islands, and so we shall speak in
turn of the Augustinian, Franciscan, Jesuit and Dominican fathers who
might have written or worked on the Doctrinas printed in 1593.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Augustinians</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first priests to come to the Philippines were six
Augustinians who accompanied Legazpi on the expedition which in 1565
established the first permanent European settlement in the islands.
Among them was Martin de Rada, who was one of the most important and
influential priests during the early days of the Spanish colony, and
who was the first linguist of note to work in the Philippines. The
first language he learned was Visayan,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e819src" href="#xd25e819" name="xd25e819src">59</a> native to the
island of Ceb&uacute; where the Spaniards first landed, but he also
learned Chinese. In May 1572 he was elected provincial of his order,
and in June 1575 he went with Jer&oacute;nimo Mar&iacute;n, as
ambassador to China, being &ldquo;the first Spaniard who entered into
that said kingdom.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e825src" href=
"#xd25e825" name="xd25e825src">60</a> In preparation for the voyage, we
are told by Gonz&aacute;lez de Mendoza, whose famous and popular
history of China first printed in 1585 derives in a great measure from
information brought back by Rada, that Rada <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e828" href="#xd25e828" name=
"xd25e828">21</a>]</span>&ldquo;began with great care &amp; studie to
learne that language [Chinese], the which he learned in few daies:
&amp; did make thereof a dictionarie.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e830src" href="#xd25e830" name="xd25e830src">61</a> Rada was then
not only the first to write in Visayan, but also the first to compile a
Chinese dictionary, and more important still brought back with him to
Manila from China many books of which Mendoza gives a list.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e839src" href="#xd25e839" name="xd25e839src">62</a>
These books, printed in the usual Chinese method from wood-blocks,
could have provided models for the Spaniards in the Philippines who
lacked European facilities for printing, and they may have given birth
to the idea which resulted in the xylographic Doctrinas.</p>
<p>Within the first few years several more Augustinian fathers<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e847src" href="#xd25e847" name="xd25e847src">63</a>
arrived whose linguistic accomplishments are briefly noted by the
historians, but while these men were certainly pioneers in the speaking
of Tagalog and Chinese, they are not recorded as having written in the
language. According to Cano,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e850src" href=
"#xd25e850" name="xd25e850src">64</a> the first Tagalog grammar was
written by Agustin de Alburquerque, and Retana<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e853src" href="#xd25e853" name="xd25e853src">65</a> considered him
one of the possible authors of the present Doctrina. This friar reached
the Philippines in 1571, accompanied Rada on his second expedition to
China in 1576, was elected provincial in 1578, and died in 1580.
However, there is no early record saying that Alburquerque wrote any
linguistic work. The statement was not made until the 19th century, and
in contradiction Juan de Medina, who wrote in 1630, said that Juan de
Qui&ntilde;ones &ldquo;made a grammar and lexicon of the Tagal
language, which was the first to make a start in the rules of its mode
of speech.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e856src" href="#xd25e856"
name="xd25e856src">66</a> Furthermore, in the official acts<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e859src" href="#xd25e859" name="xd25e859src">67</a>
of the Augustinian province we find that on August 20, 1578
Alburquerque as provincial of the order commissioned Qui&ntilde;ones to
write a grammar, dictionary and confessionary in the Tagalog language.
The conclusions of Santiago de Vela<a class="noteref" id="xd25e866src"
href="#xd25e866" name="xd25e866src">68</a> are that it is doubtful that
Alburquerque wrote any linguistic works, and if he did they were liable
to have been rough preliminary studies<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e869src" href="#xd25e869" name="xd25e869src">69</a> upon which the
texts of Qui&ntilde;ones were based. In view of the lack of positive
contemporary evidence<a class="noteref" id="xd25e878src" href=
"#xd25e878" name="xd25e878src">70</a> we believe that Alburquerque
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e887" href="#xd25e887" name=
"xd25e887">22</a>]</span>may be eliminated except as the instigator of
such works, and we return again to Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones.</p>
<p>In so far as Qui&ntilde;ones<a class="noteref" id="xd25e891src"
href="#xd25e891" name="xd25e891src">71</a> was the author of a grammar
and dictionary claimed to have been printed at Manila in 1581, we have
shown what various writers have said, and though we must conclude that
the work was probably not printed, it is certain that he wrote in the
Tagalog language. Agustin Maria de Castro<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e894src" href="#xd25e894" name="xd25e894src">72</a> said, although
no earlier writers support it, that Qui&ntilde;ones actually presented
a grammar, dictionary and Doctrina in Tagalog at the Synod of 1582 for
its approval. Our total information about this Augustinian linguist
boils down to these essentials: that he did write a grammar and
dictionary of Tagalog about 1578&ndash;81, which may have been the
earliest written in the Philippines; that he may have presented these
and a Doctrina at the Synod of 1582 which approved Juan de
Plasencia&rsquo;s works; that there is no concrete evidence that any of
these works were printed; and that Qui&ntilde;ones&rsquo; works which
were extant in manuscript in 1593 might have been consulted in the
preparation of the present Doctrina.</p>
<p>Another member of the Order of St. Augustine who might have been
able to participate in the editing of the 1593 Doctrinas was Diego
Mu&ntilde;oz. Mu&ntilde;oz came to the islands in 1578, and died in
1594. Of him San Agustin writes:</p>

<h3 class="main">The Franciscans</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the first Franciscans did not arrive in the
Philippines until June 24, 1577, the writings of the linguists of that
order are more fully recorded. Among the earliest was Juan de Plasencia
who, the Franciscans claim, wrote the first Tagalog grammar. He was
fortunate in meeting soon after his arrival Miguel de
Talavera,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e923src" href="#xd25e923" name=
"xd25e923src">76</a> who had come with his parents on the expedition of
Legazpi. Miguel, then quite young, became in a manner of speaking the
disciple of Plasencia, and while the father taught him Latin, he in
turn taught Plasencia the elements of Tagalog which he had picked up.
For two years Plasencia ministered in the provinces of Tayabas, Laguna,
and Bulacan where he used and perfected his knowledge of the native
language. On May 20, 1579, when the provincial Pedro de Alfaro left for
China, he named Plasencia acting provincial during his absence. A
reference to the earliest linguistic writings of the Franciscans occurs
in an account by Santa In&eacute;s of the chapter meeting held in the
Convent of Los Angeles in July 1580, which was presided over by
Plasencia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The third and last thing that was determined in
this chapter was that a grammar and dictionary of the Tagalog language
should be made and a translation of the Doctrina Christiana completed.
And since Fr. Juan de Plasencia, the president of this same chapter,
excelled all in the language, he was given this responsibility, and he
accepted it, and immediately set to work. And then after great study,
much lack of sleep and care, together with fervent prayers and other
spiritual duties, of not little importance in the good profit of such
work, he reduced the language to a grammar, made a catechism, a very
full dictionary, and various translations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e932src" href="#xd25e932" name="xd25e932src">77</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the most important record of his writings is contained in the
description of the Synod called by Bishop Salazar in 1582. In March,
1581, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e937" href="#xd25e937" name=
"xd25e937">24</a>]</span>Domingo de Salazar, the first Bishop of Manila
and the Philippines, had arrived. The problems which faced him were
manifold, particularly those of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the
treatment of the natives by government administrators, and the means by
which the gospel could best be spread. A synod was called to resolve
these points. One matter of the utmost importance was the approval of
standard Tagalog texts, and Juan de la Concepcion gives the following
account of what transpired in this connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;His excellency presided at the meetings. At
them the most learned topics were discussed and the most learned
persons were present&mdash;the Dominican father Salvatierra, the most
outstanding scholars among the Augustinians and Franciscans, the Jesuit
fathers Sede&ntilde;o and Sanchez, and the Licentiate Don Diego Vasquez
de Mercado as dean of the new cathedral. At this convention or diocesan
synod it was discussed whether the Indians were to be ministered to in
their native language, or if they would be obliged to learn Spanish,
and it was decided to instruct them in their native tongue. The divine
office, the Doctrina Christiana, which Father Fr. Juan de Plasencia had
translated into the Tagalog language, was approved. His work, the
<i lang="es">Arte y Vocabuldrio Tagalo</i>, was judged most useful
because of the ease by which it permitted an understanding and thorough
knowledge of so foreign a language.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e945src" href="#xd25e945" name="xd25e945src">78</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The already quoted account of Santa In&eacute;s continues with a
similar description of the Synod, and says that when the problem of
teaching the natives was brought up only Plasencia could resolve
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Since, having seen his catechism and the
translation which he had made in Tagalog of the grammar and dictionary,
those who were at the Synod and understood anything of the language
could do nothing but admire the fitness of the terms, their efficacy
and strength. And they said that, without the particular help of
heaven, it seemed impossible that in so short a time and with so few
years in the country he could have done such excellent work. And then,
having approved them, they ordered that various copies be made,
particularly of the translation of the Doctrina, so that with them and
with no other would the ministers teach the Indians, and so it was
approved, in order that there might be uniformity in all parts of the
Tagalog country. This translation is that which has come down to this
day, except that it is more polished.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e968src" href="#xd25e968" name="xd25e968src">79</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must have been shortly after the handbooks of Plasencia received
the seal of ecclesiastical approval that Salazar wrote the King
speaking of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e979" href=
"#xd25e979" name="xd25e979">25</a>]</span>action taken, and got back in
answer the cedula, quoted before, giving the Bishop and Audiencia the
right of censorship over such works. The question of chronological
precedence<a class="noteref" id="xd25e981src" href="#xd25e981" name=
"xd25e981src">80</a> between Qui&ntilde;ones and Plasencia is not
important, for the specific approval of Plasencia&rsquo;s texts by the
Synod, attended by Qui&ntilde;ones himself, shows that
Plasencia&rsquo;s books were accepted, and in conformity with the
ruling of the Synod would have been the only texts allowed to be used
generally in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Another reference to writers in the native tongues in an anonymous
manuscript of 1649 introduces the names of other linguists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The first missionaries left many writings in
the Tagalog and Bicol languages, the best of which are those left by
Fathers Fray Juan de Oliver, Fray Juan de Plasencia, Fray Miguel de
Talavera, Fray Diego de la Asuncion, and Fray Ger&oacute;nimo Monte.
Mention is here made of the above fathers because they were the first
masters of the Tagalog language, and since their writings are so common
and so well received by all the orders. They have not been printed,
because they are voluminous, and there are no arrangements in this
kingdom for printing so much.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e992src"
href="#xd25e992" name="xd25e992src">81</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miguel de Talavera we have spoken of before. That he helped
Plasencia in the compilation of his earliest works in Tagalog is clear,
and to him in part must be attributed the miracle of the production by
Plasencia of the texts &ldquo;in so short a time and with so few years
in the country.&rdquo; Mart&iacute;nez says specifically that Talavera
&ldquo;was the first interpreter among our priests, and greatly helped
Fr. Juan de Plasencia in the composition of the <i lang="es">Arte y
Vocabulario</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1005src" href=
"#xd25e1005" name="xd25e1005src">82</a> Juan de Oliver was in somewhat
the same relationship to Plasencia, but instead of helping with the
initial attempts, he carried on from where Plasencia left off. Oliver
came to the Philippines on the same expedition which brought Bishop
Salazar in 1581. According to Huerta<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1008src" href="#xd25e1008" name="xd25e1008src">83</a> he worked
in various Tagalog villages, and mastered the Tagalog and Bicol
languages, in which he wrote twenty-two works, which Huerta lists. Of
these three are of particular interest to us. The first entry says that
he &ldquo;corrected the Tagalog grammar written by Fr. Juan de
Plasencia, and added the adverbs and particles;&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1017src" href="#xd25e1017" name=
"xd25e1017src">84</a> the second that &ldquo;he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1023" href="#xd25e1023" name=
"xd25e1023">26</a>]</span>perfected and augmented the Spanish-Tagalog
dictionary, written by the said Fr. Juan de Plasencia;&rdquo; and the
sixteenth lists a <i lang="es">Catecismo de doctrina Cristiana
esplicado</i>.</p>
<p>Several authors, attempting to establish the priority of
Qui&ntilde;ones&rsquo; dictionary, question the existence of one by
Plasencia at the Synod of 1582 in the face of his own statement in 1585
that he &ldquo;was then making a dictionary.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1031src" href="#xd25e1031" name="xd25e1031src">85</a> To us
there seems to be no inconsistency, if Plasencia in 1585 was referring
to a revision, unquestionably made with his knowledge and help, by Juan
de Oliver. In short, it is reasonable to assume that Plasencia,
burdened with administrative duties from 1583 to 1586, during which
time he was custodian of his order, secured the aid of Oliver in
reediting and continuing his linguistic studies. Plasencia died in
1590.</p>
<p>The other two Franciscans listed by the anonymous historian of 1649
are elsewhere recorded as having written various works in Tagalog. To
both Diego de la Asuncion<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1036src" href=
"#xd25e1036" name="xd25e1036src">86</a> and Ger&oacute;nimo Montes y
Escamillo<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1045src" href="#xd25e1045" name=
"xd25e1045src">87</a> were attributed grammars and dictionaries, and
the latter also wrote a <i lang="es">Devotional tagalog</i>, said to
have been printed at Manila in 1610. In speaking of these early
linguistic texts, it is not necessary to believe that each was a
completely original work, but rather that they were based upon a
recognized model, which was at first the Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver
text, and that the individual missionaries used their experience in the
field to produce, as it were, new editions. That this was the case is
borne out by the notes of Pablo Rojo to his bibliography of Plasencia
where speaking of the grammar and dictionary he says that
&ldquo;perfected by other missionaries, they have been the base for
such grammars and dictionaries of Tagalog as have been written, but in
the form in which they came from the hands of their author, they have
not come down to us.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1070src" href=
"#xd25e1070" name="xd25e1070src">88</a> More important still is
Rojo&rsquo;s statement<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1082src" href=
"#xd25e1082" name="xd25e1082src">89</a> that he found a portion of
Plasencia&rsquo;s Doctrina which had been believed lost, and from which
he quotes the Pater Noster. Since he does not say where the manuscript
was or how it was known to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1086"
href="#xd25e1086" name="xd25e1086">27</a>]</span>Plasencia&rsquo;s
text, we cannot put too much reliance on the statement, but the text as
there printed, while similar to that of the present Doctrina, is not
identical.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Jesuits</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before passing on to the Dominicans we shall mention
briefly the linguists of the Society of Jesus. In the early days there
were not many Jesuits in the Philippines. However, there were some
linguists among them, chiefly of the Visayan tongue, in which they are
said to have printed a Doctrina<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1094src"
href="#xd25e1094" name="xd25e1094src">90</a> as early as 1610. Limiting
ourselves to a note of those who knew Chinese and Tagalog, we find that
the first mentioned by Chirino as an outstanding master of one of these
was Francisco Almerique, who arrived with Santiago de Vera in 1583.
Shortly thereafter he &ldquo;began the study of the Chinese language in
his zeal to aid in the conversion of the many Chinese who came to
Manila and whom we in the Philippines call Sangleys.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1097src" href="#xd25e1097" name=
"xd25e1097src">91</a> And Colin says &ldquo;his principal occupation
was with the Tagalog Indians, being the first of the Company to learn
their language.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1100src" href=
"#xd25e1100" name="xd25e1100src">92</a> Nothing further is said of his
accomplishments in these languages, but his knowledge would have been
available in 1593, for he was then still active in the islands.</p>
<p>Chirino himself landed at Manila in 1590 shortly after
Dasmari&ntilde;as, and went almost immediately to Taytay where he
learned Tagalog and was joined in 1592 by Martin Henriquez. At the time
Juan de Oliver was preaching in that district, and it is exceedingly
probable that he helped the newcomers with the language, for Chirino
speaks of him in terms of highest praise. Henriquez &ldquo;learned the
language in three months and in six wrote a catechism in it, a
confessionary, and a book of sermons for all the gospels of the year in
the said idiom,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1105src" href=
"#xd25e1105" name="xd25e1105src">93</a> but he died on February 3, 1593
at Taytay. How thoroughly Chirino himself had grasped the fundamentals
of Tagalog is evident from his three chapters<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1108src" href="#xd25e1108" name="xd25e1108src">94</a> on the
language and letters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1111" href=
"#xd25e1111" name="xd25e1111">28</a>]</span>of the natives in which he
prints the Ave Maria in Tagalog and reproduces the Tagalog
alphabet&mdash;its first appearance in a European publication. But
Chirino, who remained in the provinces until 1595, would have mentioned
his participation and that of Henriquez in the Doctrina of 1593, so we
record them as possible but not probable consultants.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Dominicans</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Had Aduarte written that the first books printed at
Manila were two Doctrinas issued by the Dominicans at San Gabriel in
1593, and given some details of their production, we could conclude our
study with a quotation from him, but nowhere does he mention them. In
fact, his inference was that the first book was that printed for
Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, and yet we know that this Doctrina preceded
anything that Blancas de San Jos&eacute; could have written, since he
did not come to the Philippines until 1595. We can assume, as Retana
did, that by printing Aduarte meant printing from movable type, but
this does not explain away the fact that Aduarte, who recorded in
detail events of far less significance, did not speak of the Doctrinas
at all. The best&mdash;and it is a most unsatisfactory best&mdash;that
we can do is ascribe the omission to the frailty of man, and record
that there is no notice of the Dominican Doctrina of 1593 in the most
complete contemporary Dominican history of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The first members of the Order of St. Dominic<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1120src" href="#xd25e1120" name="xd25e1120src">95</a> to land in
the Philippines were Bishop Salazar and his assistant, Christoval de
Salvatierra. But they were fully occupied with the administration of
the bishopric and could not devote themselves to regular missionary
work. It was not until July 25, 1587 that working Dominican
missionaries came. Then fifteen<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1126src"
href="#xd25e1126" name="xd25e1126src">96</a> under the leadership of
Juan de Castro arrived, and established the first Dominican
province<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1129src" href="#xd25e1129" name=
"xd25e1129src">97</a> of the Philippines and China, thus consummating
the hope expressed as early as 1579.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1135src" href="#xd25e1135" name="xd25e1135src">98</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1138" href="#xd25e1138" name=
"xd25e1138">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>In consultation with the other orders it was decided that the
Dominicans should be given the ministry of the territories of
Pangasinan and Bataan, which had theretofore been spiritually exploited
by few priests. Almost immediately, on September 15, 1587, the
vicariate of Bataan was founded and settled. In speaking of it, Aduarte
stressed the importance of a knowledge of the language of the natives,
which there would have been Tagalog, to the success of the mission.
Domingo de Nieva, one of the four members of the mission, learned it
rapidly and well, and soon began to preach to the Indians in their own
tongue. His aptitude for languages and its usefulness to the Dominicans
must have been very great, for Aduarte in listing the priests who
originally volunteered in Spain makes few comments about individuals,
but of Nieva he remarks that he &ldquo;was afterwards of great
importance because of the great ease and skill with which he learned
languages, whether Indian or Chinese.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1141src" href="#xd25e1141" name="xd25e1141src">99</a>
Unfortunately Nieva was only a deacon, and so could not hear
confession, a fact which was greatly deplored, because during that
first year no other priest mastered the language sufficiently well to
do it, but in September 1588 he reached the requisite age and was
ordained. About that time the friars in Bataan&mdash;one had died and
another was ailing&mdash;were joined by Juan de la Cruz, &ldquo;who,
being young, succeeded very well with the language,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1144src" href="#xd25e1144" name=
"xd25e1144src">100</a> and also succeeded in surviving the climate.</p>
<p>Early in 1588 Juan Cobo<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1149src" href=
"#xd25e1149" name="xd25e1149src">101</a> arrived from Mexico. Shortly
thereafter, on June 12, 1588, the Dominican chapter held its first
convocation. It elected Juan de Castro the first provincial, adopted
the general ordinances<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1152src" href=
"#xd25e1152" name="xd25e1152src">102</a> already made in Mexico, gave
the convent at Manila the title of priory, and designated as parts of
the province four vicariates. Of primary importance was the appointment
then of Juan Cobo to the mission for the Chinese.</p>
<p>From the very earliest days of the Spanish occupation of Manila, the
governors had had trouble with the Chinese and Sangleys.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1160src" href="#xd25e1160" name=
"xd25e1160src">103</a> These people <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1172" href="#xd25e1172" name="xd25e1172">30</a>]</span>had long
conducted a profitable trade between China and the Philippines, and
many had settled permanently near Manila, while others stayed there
regularly between trading voyages. The Chinese merchants were in full
control of the shops of the city, and so monopolized retail trade that
the early governors legislated<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1174src"
href="#xd25e1174" name="xd25e1174src">104</a> against them to give the
Spaniards a chance to establish themselves in business. In 1588 there
were as many as seven thousand of them in and around Manila.</p>
<p>No one had objected to the Pangasinan and Bataan assignments, but
when it was suggested that the Dominicans also assume the
responsibility for the ministry over the Chinese and Sangleys in the
suburbs of Manila, the Augustinians vehemently resented what they
considered an invasion of their prior rights. Aduarte omits any account
of a disagreement, merely saying that since the Chinese had had no one
to minister to them the Dominicans assumed that responsibility, but in
a letter<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1179src" href="#xd25e1179" name=
"xd25e1179src">105</a> from the Licentiate Gaspar de Ayala to Philip
II, dated from Manila, July 15, 1589, full details of the squabble are
given. From this source we learn that the Augustinians had a convent in
the village of Tondo in the Chinese district. There they had ministered
to the natives in their own language, but had rather neglected their
Chinese-speaking parishioners. Consequently after the arrival of the
Dominicans the Audiencia passed an ordinance requiring that the Bishop
appoint ministers of one order to administer to the Chinese in their
own language within thirty days. To meet the deadline the Augustinians
began to study Chinese at breakneck speed, but when the Bishop came to
Tondo to hear one of the friars, who was supposed to know the language,
preach in it, there was some trouble as a result of which the
Augustinian would not, or indeed could not, preach. Naturally, when it
was decided to award the territory to the Dominicans, the Augustinians
accused the Bishop of favoritism towards his own order.</p>
<p>The whole situation is best described in the report on the Chinese
made by Salazar to the King on June 24, 1590: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1184" href="#xd25e1184" name=
"xd25e1184">31</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;When I arrived in this land, I found that in a
village called Tondo&mdash;which is not far from this city, there being
a river between&mdash;lived many Sangleys, of whom some were
Christians, but the larger part infidels. In this city were also some
shops kept by Sangleys, who lived here in order to sell the goods which
they kept here year by year. These Sangleys were scattered among the
Spaniards, with no specific place assigned to them, until Don Gonzalo
Ronquillo allotted them a place to live in, and to be used as a
silk-market (which is here called <i>Pari&aacute;n</i>), of four large
buildings. Here, many shops were opened, commerce increased, and more
Sangleys came to this city&#8202;&hellip;. When I came, all the
Sangleys were almost forgotten, and relegated to a corner. No thought
was taken for their conversion, because no one knew their language or
undertook to learn it on account of its great difficulty; and because
the religious who lived here were too busy with the natives of these
islands. Although the Augustinian religious had charge of the Sangleys
of Tondo, they did not minister to or instruct them in their own
language, but in that of the natives or this land; thus the Sangley
Christians living here, were Christians only in name, knowing no more
of Christianity than if they had never accepted it&#8202;&hellip;. Then
I appealed to all religious orders to appoint some one of their
religious to learn the language and take charge of the Sangleys.
Although all of them showed a desire to do so, and some even began to
learn it, yet no one succeeded; and the Sangleys found themselves with
no one to instruct them and take up their conversion with the necessary
earnestness, until, in the year eighty-seven, God brought to these
islands the religious of St. Dominic.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1191src" href="#xd25e1191" name="xd25e1191src">106</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we find, as the Dominicans undertook their mission, a large
settlement of Chinese, including both a settled and a floating
population, concentrated in the Pari&aacute;n, across the Pasig river
from the main city of Manila.</p>
<p>The dominating figure of the Chinese mission from the time of his
arrival in the Philippines was Juan Cobo. In a letter, written by him
from the Pari&aacute;n of Manila, July 13, 1589, probably to
ecclesiastical authorities in Mexico, he gives an account of the early
days of the mission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Order took a site next to this
Pari&aacute;n, since there was not a single house between Santo Domingo
and the Pari&aacute;n. And because of this opportunity the Order
presently charged itself with the Chinese, both Christians and
infidels. And upon P. Fr. Miguel de Benavides and P. Fr. Juan Maldonado
was imposed the responsibility for the care of the Chinese and for
learning their language. P. Fr. Miguel was less occupied with other
matters than Fr. Juan Maldonado, so that he progressed in the language
enough to begin to catechize in it. This was the first year the Order
was in Manila. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1204" href=
"#xd25e1204" name="xd25e1204">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently in the second year when I came, the Order moved P.
Fr. Miguel and myself into another separate house at the other edge of
the Pari&aacute;n. So that there stood between Santo Domingo and San
Gabriel, which is the name of this church of the Chinese, the whole of
the Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys. And there a poor little church was
built under the protection of San Gabriel, to whom it fell by lot, and
a poor house where we two lived. We entered into it at the beginning of
September 1588. This was the first church for the Chinese built, and we
believe that there is today not another parish church [for the Chinese]
but that&#8202;&hellip;. And P. Fr. Miguel catechized them and preached
to them in their Chinese language, and taught the doctrine in it. I
myself did not yet know the language, but the Lord has been served, so
that in a short time I progressed in it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1207src" href="#xd25e1207" name="xd25e1207src">107</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The account of Aduarte is not so accurate in some details, but it
supplies others not mentioned by Cobo. The first mission which
Benavides and Maldonado (or de San Pedro Martyr as he was later known)
built was near the village of Tondo, in a new settlement specially
founded for Christian Chinese, called Baybay, and it was named for Our
Lady of the Purification. The second mission which was established by
Benavides and Cobo was at first a palm-leaf hut. The name of San
Gabriel was decided upon by making lots with the names of various
saints on them and then drawing. San Gabriel came out three times in a
row, and &ldquo;all were persuaded that the Lord was pleased to have
the patronage belong to this holy archangel.&rdquo; Soon, because of
the good works of the fathers who established a hospital there for the
care of the sick and poor, the demands upon the hut became so great
that a larger building was planned. At first it was to have been
erected on the site of the hut, but the inhabitants protested that a
stone building so near native houses might do them great damage in the
event of an earthquake, so the friars went to the other side of the
river, and there built a temporary building of wood which was later
completed in stone. It was here then that the Doctrina was printed, in
the Church of San Gabriel, near the Pari&aacute;n of Manila, at the
edge of the Chinese settlement.</p>
<p>Under the care of Benavides and Cobo the mission flourished, and the
two fathers became increasingly proficient in the Chinese language.
When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1215" href="#xd25e1215" name=
"xd25e1215">33</a>]</span>the provincial Juan de Castro began making
preparations for an inspection tour of his Chinese vicariate in 1590,
he chose as his companion Miguel de Benavides. The account of the
events leading up to this expedition is given in the already quoted
letter of Salazar on the Chinese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Of the Dominican religious who came to these
islands, four are engaged in ministering to the Sangleys. Two of these
four officiate in the Church of San Gabriel, which, together with the
house where the religious live, stands close to the Pari&aacute;n.
Another church with its house is on the promontory of Baybay, near
Tondo&mdash;which a river divides, separating it from Manila. Two of
the four have learned the language of the Sangleys so well, and one of
these two how to write also (which is the most difficult part of the
language), that the Sangleys wonder at their knowledge&#8202;&hellip;.
After due consideration of the matter, the Dominican fathers and myself
decided that it was necessary to go to China&#8202;&hellip;. Thus we
decided upon the departure, sending at present no more than two
religious: Fray Miguel de Benavides, who was the first to learn the
language of the Sangleys; and Father Juan de Castro, who came as vicar
of the religious and who was made provincial here. We preferred these
two, as one is well acquainted with the language, and the other is much
loved and esteemed by the Sangleys on account of his venerable gray
locks and blessed old age; and we know that in that land old people are
much respected and revered.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1220src"
href="#xd25e1220" name="xd25e1220src">108</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They sailed on May 22, 1590, but Juan de Castro before he left
appointed Cobo acting superior of the province with full authority
during his absence, and in the latter&rsquo;s place as head of the
Chinese mission sent Juan de San Pedro Martyr.</p>
<p>There is no doubt but that at this time Benavides and Cobo were the
two outstanding Chinese linguists among the Spaniards in the
Philippines. To Benavides has been attributed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1227src" href="#xd25e1227" name="xd25e1227src">109</a> a Chinese
dictionary, and Schilling<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1236src" href=
"#xd25e1236" name="xd25e1236src">110</a> uses the already quoted letter
of Cobo to prove that he also wrote a Doctrina in Chinese, but,
granting that such works were written by him, there is no evidence that
they were written in Chinese characters, and not in Chinese
transliterated into roman letters. The available evidence points to the
fact that Cobo was the only one who could then write in Chinese
characters. Salazar in his above quoted letter had said that &ldquo;one
of these two [have learned] how to write also,&rdquo; and in the same
letter he continued, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1239" href=
"#xd25e1239" name="xd25e1239">34</a>]</span>&ldquo;Fray Juan Cobo, the
Dominican religious&mdash;who, as I have said before, knows the
language of the Sangleys and their writing, and who is most esteemed by
them&mdash;is sending to Your Majesty a book, one of a number brought
to him from China.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1241src" href=
"#xd25e1241" name="xd25e1241src">111</a> Further witness to
Cobo&rsquo;s amazing knowledge of Chinese writing is given by
Aduarte:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;He knew three thousand Chinese characters, each
different from all the rest, for the Chinese have no definite number of
letters nor alphabet&#8202;&hellip;. He translated a number [of Chinese
books]; for like those of Seneca, though they are the work of heathens,
they contain many profound sayings like ours. He taught astrology to
some of them whom he found capable of learning; and to bring them by
all means to their salvation also taught them some trades that are
necessary among Spaniards, but which, not being used by the Chinese,
they did not know&mdash;such as painting images, binding books, cutting
and sewing clothes, and such things&mdash;doing all to win men to
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1247src" href="#xd25e1247" name=
"xd25e1247src">112</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, as a more definite proof that Cobo could have been the
author of the Chinese Doctrina of 1593, we have the record<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1252src" href="#xd25e1252" name=
"xd25e1252src">113</a> of a <i lang="es">Catecismo de la Doctrina
Cristiana en Lengua China</i> written by him, as well as many other
works in Chinese.</p>
<p>In May 1590, then, the most accomplished Sinologist yet to work in
the Philippines was in charge of the Dominican province. &ldquo;His
first act,&rdquo; wrote Aduarte, &ldquo;was to strengthen the ministry
to the Chinese by appointing to it Father Domingo de Nieva, a priest of
great virtue and very able&mdash;which was tremendously important
there&mdash;and one who best mastered that language, as well as that of
the Indians in which he had had experience; and he worked in both of
them, and wrote much to the great advantage of those who came after
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1298src" href="#xd25e1298" name=
"xd25e1298src">114</a> It is surprising that no previous writer has
emphasized the presence of Domingo de Nieva, whose proficiency in
Tagalog we have already noted, at San Gabriel during the years when the
printing of the Doctrinas must have been planned and executed. His
works are cited by Fern&aacute;ndez,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1301src" href="#xd25e1301" name="xd25e1301src">115</a> and after
giving a summary of his career, Aduarte added: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1319" href="#xd25e1319" name=
"xd25e1319">35</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;He wrote much in the language of the Indians
and other things in the language of the Chinese for whom he had printed
in their language and characters a memorial upon the Christian life,
with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation, in preparation for
the holy sacraments, of confession and the sacred communion. He was an
enemy of sloth, and so worked much in Chinese, in which he wrote a
practically new grammar of the Chinese language, a vocabulary, a manual
of confession and many sermons, in order that those who had to learn
this language might find it less difficult.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1323src" href="#xd25e1323" name="xd25e1323src">116</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Medina<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1328src" href="#xd25e1328" name=
"xd25e1328src">117</a> records these various works as Manila imprints
of unknown date, and to this indefinite information about them we can
add nothing positive. However, it is apparent that some time before
1606, when Nieva died on his way to Mexico, he had had books printed,
and since they were in Chinese they must have been printed from
wood-blocks, for at that early date it would have been impossible to
have cast the number of characters necessary to print in Chinese with
movable type.</p>
<p>With Nieva was Maldonado, or San Pedro Martyr. He had been one of
the first associates of Benavides in the first Chinese mission at
Baybay, but after the arrival of Cobo he had been sent by order of the
first chapter to Pangasinan. When Cobo was appointed acting provincial
San Pedro Martyr was again assigned to the Chinese ministry. He had
learned Tagalog, and after his return to the Pari&aacute;n &ldquo;he
learned more words of the Chinese language than any other member of the
order, though he was not successful with the
pronunciation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1333src" href=
"#xd25e1333" name="xd25e1333src">118</a></p>
<p>On May 31, 1592, the Governor received a letter from the Emperor of
Japan demanding that an ambassador be sent to offer him the fealty of
the Philippines. Juan Cobo, as the best speaker of Chinese, was chosen
to represent the Spaniards, and he left Manila on July 29, 1592. After
successfully convincing the Japanese Emperor of the amity of the
Spaniards, he left to come back to Manila, but his ship was wrecked in
November on the coast of Formosa, and there Cobo was killed by hostile
natives. Meanwhile Benavides had gone back to Spain with Bishop Salazar
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1338" href="#xd25e1338" name=
"xd25e1338">36</a>]</span>1591, and did not return to the Philippines
until after his appointment as Bishop of Nueva Segovia in 1595.</p>
<p>That left as the only two remaining experts in the Chinese language,
Domingo de Nieva and Juan de San Pedro Martyr, both of whom were at San
Gabriel in 1592. <i>Moreover, both of them knew Chinese and
Tagalog.</i> A text in Tagalog was available, based on the
Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver model, which had circulated freely, and this,
we believe, was further edited&mdash;hence the &ldquo;corrected by the
religious of the orders&rdquo;&mdash;by these two Dominicans. In their
editorial work they may have been helped by Juan de la Cruz, who, we
have noted, was sent to Bataan in 1588, there learned Tagalog, and
&ldquo;succeeded so perfectly with it that Father Fr. Francisco San
Joseph, who was afterwards the best linguist there, profited by the
papers and labors of P. Fr. Juan de la Cruz.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1345src" href="#xd25e1345" name="xd25e1345src">119</a> Juan de
Oliver, the pioneer Franciscan Tagalist was still living and available
for consultation, and the polylingual Jesuit, Francisco Almerique, also
was in Manila at the time. A Chinese text had been written by Juan
Cobo, and both Nieva and San Pedro Martyr were capable of preparing
this for publication, again possibly aided by Almerique, and also Diego
Mu&ntilde;oz, if as an Augustinian he had been willing to cooperate
with the Dominicans. Nothing remained to be done but have the blocks
cut and the impressions pulled.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Printing of the Books</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The stage was set for the production of the Doctrinas.
That there were Chinese xylographic models upon which the books could
be based is evidenced by the account of Mendoza of the considerable
number of Chinese books brought to Manila by Martin de Rada as early as
1575. A more likely model was a bilingual text in Spanish and Chinese
which Cobo describes in his letter of July 13, 1589, where speaking of
the Jesuits in China he says: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1353"
href="#xd25e1353" name="xd25e1353">37</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Moreover the Father of the Company who was in
China wrote and printed in Chinese letters a whole book of the unity of
God, the creation of the world, and the commandments explained; and in
this book has gotten as far as the incarnation of the Son of God.
Concerning this I am not speaking of things heard, for I have it, and
am thus certain of it, as of all the things that happened. How far I
have progressed with the Chinese letters I shall say later. This book
was printed in China in 1584. It circulates freely in China whence we
have our copy, and because of the writing, contrary to what others have
misleadingly said about the Chinese, they have done him no ill: from
which it may be inferred that the lion is not so wild as they paint
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1357src" href="#xd25e1357" name=
"xd25e1357src">120</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no direct evidence to support our belief that it was during
the brief period after Castro returned, probably late in 1590, and
relieved Cobo of his executive responsibilities, and June 1592 when he
left for Japan, that Cobo began intensive plans for the production of
bilingual texts. His recorded interest in such books, his influence
with the Chinese, his energy and his own linguistic aptitude would
naturally have stimulated him to undertake the task. Whether he
actually began work on the blocks from which the books were printed, or
merely suggested the feasibility of the idea, we do not know, but we
feel sure that Juan Cobo was the father of the production of books in
the Philippines.</p>
<p>There is no need here to go into the history of printing in China;
the method used there and its antiquity have been fully described by
others.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1364src" href="#xd25e1364" name=
"xd25e1364src">121</a> That there were Chinese in Manila who understood
this age-old process would seem obvious from the reports of skilled
craftsmen whose presence was noted by all the writers of the period. We
have already quoted a reference to Juan Cobo&rsquo;s teaching them
European trades, and Salazar in his already cited letter speaks of them
further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;They are so skillful and clever, that, as soon
as they see any object made by a Spanish workman, they reproduce it
with exactness. What arouses my wonder most is, that when I arrived no
Sangley knew how to paint anything; but now they have so perfected
themselves in this art that they have produced marvelous works with
both the brush and the chisel&#8202;&hellip;. What has pleased all of
us here has been the arrival of a bookbinder from Mexico. He brought
books with him, set up a bindery, and hired a Sangley who had offered
his services to him. The Sangley secretly, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1379" href="#xd25e1379" name=
"xd25e1379">38</a>]</span>without his master noticing it, watched how
the latter bound books, and lo, in less than [lacuna in MS.] he left
the house, saying that he wished to serve him no longer, and set up a
similar shop.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1381src" href=
"#xd25e1381" name="xd25e1381src">122</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To turn over a manuscript copy of a book to a Chinaman who had
already some familiarity with the production of books in China, or who
with a given text could carve the blocks according to tradition, was
then not a matter of great difficulty. There were Chinese books which
showed what the result would be; there were Spanish books, definitely
some from Mexico, which provided samples of European characters and
format.</p>
<p>Who cut the blocks&mdash;that is exactly what Chinaman&mdash;we do
not know, nor do we know who handled the presswork, but it is logical
to assume that the whole process took place under the supervision of
the fathers of San Gabriel, Juan Cobo if work had begun before 1592,
and certainly Nieva and San Pedro Martyr. One further aide may have
been the lay brother, Pedro Rodriguez, who had been sent to San Gabriel
with Nieva, and who was a handyman or skilled mechanic, for Aduarte
credits him with rebuilding and restoring the hospital.</p>
<p>In speaking of the book printed for Blancas de San Jos&eacute;,
Aduarte said that the printing had been done by &ldquo;a Chinaman, a
good Christian,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1390src" href=
"#xd25e1390" name="xd25e1390src">123</a> but in this particular account
he does not give the Chinaman&rsquo;s name. Yet, where he describes the
founding of a second church of San Gabriel in Binondo, sometime after
March 28, 1594<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1393src" href="#xd25e1393"
name="xd25e1393src">124</a> and before June 15, 1596 when it was
admitted to the chapter, he tells in some detail of printing done by
Juan de Vera.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1399src" href="#xd25e1399"
name="xd25e1399src">125</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;There have been in this town [Binondo, then
called Minondoc] many Chinese of very exemplary lives. Juan de Vera was
not only a very devout man, and one much given to prayer, but a man who
caused all his household to be the same. He always heard mass, and was
very regular in his attendance at church. He adorned the church most
handsomely with hangings and paintings, because he understood this art.
He also, thinking only of the great results to be attained by means of
holy and devout books, gave himself to the great labor necessary to
establish printing in this country, where there was no journeyman who
could show him the way, or give him an <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1405" href="#xd25e1405" name="xd25e1405">39</a>]</span>account of
the manner of printing in Europe, which is very different from the
manner of printing followed in his own country of China. The Lord aided
his pious intentions, and he gave to this undertaking not only
continued and excessive labor, but all the forces of his mind, which
were great. In spite of the difficulties, he attained that which he
desired, and was the first printer in these islands; and this not from
avarice&mdash;for he gained much more in his business as a merchant,
and readily gave up his profit&mdash;but merely to do service to the
Lord and this good to the souls of the natives.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1407src" href="#xd25e1407" name=
"xd25e1407src">126</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note that this narrative, which is in substance
similar to that about the books of Blancas de San Jos&eacute;, nowhere
mentions the name of the priest in connection with Vera. It is probable
that Juan de Vera was, as Retana believed, the first typographer, and
it may be that he also printed the Doctrinas of 1593. It is impossible
to say with certainty, but it is not too fanciful to suppose that Juan
de Vera tried xylographic printing under the supervision of Nieva and
San Pedro Martyr, and after some experimenting achieved typography in
the time of Blancas de San Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p>Since we have here dealt with a volume printed entirely from
wood-blocks it does not seem necessary to discuss in detail the
subsequent typographical books. However, just as this goes to press, a
copy of the <i lang="la">Ordinationes Generales prouintiae Sanctissimi
Rosarij Philippinarum</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1417src" href=
"#xd25e1417" name="xd25e1417src">127</a> printed at Binondo by Juan de
Vera in 1604, has been discovered, and also presented by Mr. Rosenwald
to the Library of Congress. This is the volume described by
Remesal<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1429src" href="#xd25e1429" name=
"xd25e1429src">128</a> as being printed &ldquo;in as fine characters
and as correctly as if in Rome or Lyon.&rdquo; No copy of the book had
been described since his day, although Medina<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1432src" href="#xd25e1432" name="xd25e1432src">129</a> and
Retana<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1438src" href="#xd25e1438" name=
"xd25e1438src">130</a> both listed it from references which probably
derived from Remesal. Its discovery&mdash;almost unbelievable coming so
close on the heels of that of the Doctrina&mdash;helps to close the gap
between the latter and the two Bataan imprints<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1445src" href="#xd25e1445" name="xd25e1445src">131</a> of 1610,
the <i lang="es">Arte y Reglas de la Lengva Tagala</i> and the <i lang=
"tl">Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang uicang Castilla</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1457" href="#xd25e1457" name=

<p>The full story of the early typographical products of the
Philippines must wait upon another occasion, for the questions posed by
the scanty records and the handful of surviving books are extremely
knotty. Where did the type come from? Medina suggested it was imported
from Macao; Retana believed it to have been cut in the Philippines.
Fern&aacute;ndez said that the first works of Blancas de San
Jos&eacute; were printed at Bataan and the two 1610 books have that
place of printing, yet in 1604 the <i lang="es">Ordinationes</i> issued
from Binondo. Remesal wrote that this book was printed by Francisco de
Vera, and the book itself bears the name of Juan. Indeed, the history
of the early typographers and the output of their presses, as it has so
far been written, presents many problems, but they are problems which
we feel are outside the scope of this study.</p>
<p>To summarize what we have learned of the earliest printing in the
Philippines: we have the possibility, but not a likely one, that an
<i lang="es">Arte</i> by Juan de Qui&ntilde;ones was printed
xylographically in 1581; we know that in the first half of the year
1593 two Doctrinas were printed xylographically&mdash;although we have
no way of telling which came first&mdash;one in Tagalog from the
Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver text, and one in Chinese written by Juan
Cobo, both edited and printed under the supervision of Domingo de Nieva
and Juan de San Pedro Martyr; we surmise that between 1593 and 1602
other works were also printed xylographically, such as the small tracts
of Juan de Villanueva and some of the books of Blancas de San
Jos&eacute;, Nieva and others; and in 1602 was printed by Juan de Vera,
in all likelihood from movable type, the book of Our Lady of the Rosary
by Blancas de San Jos&eacute;. The known facts are not many, and we can
only hope that time and further research will discover new ones to make
the history of the earliest Philippine imprints more complete and more
satisfactory.</p>

Cuellar was mentioned in the Letter of Instruction given by
Philip&nbsp;II to G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as on August
9, 1589, as among those &ldquo;who are men of worth and account&rdquo;
in the Philippines and who should be provided for and rewarded
accordingly, B. &amp; R., VII, p. 151, translated from the original MS.
in the A. of I. (105&ndash;2&ndash;11), Torres, III, no. 3567, p. 17.
Cuellar received a commission from Dasmari&ntilde;as and signed various
documents during his administration as secretary and notary. Antonio de
Morga, <i lang="es">Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas</i>, Mexico, 1609,
f. 13v, reports that Cuellar was one of two survivors of the ship on
which Dasmari&ntilde;as sailed in October 1593 as part of an expedition
to conquer the fort of Terrenate in Maluco. On the second day out,
while the ship was weather-bound at Punta del Acufre, the Chinese
rowers mutinied, and only Cuellar, there described as the
governor&rsquo;s secretary, and the Franciscan father, Francisco de
Montilla, survived the ensuing massacre. They were set ashore on the
coast of Ylocos, and made their way back to Manila. A similar account
appears in Chapter XVI of Leonardo de Argensola&rsquo;s, <i lang=

from which the present passage was quoted by Retana, col. 25. For an
account of the MS. see Santiago Vela, VI, p. 435n. Schilling, p. 214,
demonstrates that according to the original punctuation the meaning is
that the first printers were Villanueva and Blancas de San Jos&eacute;,
but with the shifting of a semi-colon it could be read to mean that the
first printers were of the Order of St. Augustine. We can see no reason
to shift the semi-colon, and have retained it in its original
place.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e349src">&uarr;</a></p>

col. 26, said that he was able to find no information regarding
Villanueva except for the listing of his name by Cano, p. 43, as having
arrived in the Philippines at an unknown date. The destruction of the
early records of the Augustinians when the English sacked Manila in
1762 accounts for the paucity of information, but there are a few
references which throw some little light on the two Villanuevas. San
Agustin, p. 212, says that when Herrara sailed for Mexico in 1569 he
left in Ceb&uacute; only &ldquo;P. Fr. Martin de Rada and two virtuous
clerics, the one named Juan de Vivero, and the other Juan de
Villanueva, who had come with Felipe de Salcedo.&rdquo; Salcedo had
come back to Ceb&uacute; in 1566. Francisco Moreno, <i lang=
"es">Historia de la Santa Iglesia Metropolitana de Filipinas hasta
1650</i>, Manila, 1877, p. 226, states that Villanueva came in 1566,
and died shortly after 1569. San Antonio, I, p. 173, writes,
&ldquo;Another cleric was the Licentiate Don Juan de Villanueva, of
whom the only thing known is that he was a churchman and lived but a
short time&mdash;and that after the erection of the church.&rdquo; This
refers to the foundation of the church in Manila in 1571. Of the other
Villanueva our information comes from Perez, p. 63.&nbsp;<a class=

merely says that he took his information &ldquo;from the best

1788&ndash;92, II, pp. 45&ndash;6. Schilling, p. 203n, maintains that
the early writers were mistaken in believing that the Synod was held in
1581. On October 16, 1581 the Bishop called a meeting of ten priests at
the Convent of Tondo to discuss the execution of the decree about
slaves, Torres, II, pp. cxliv&ndash;v. No laymen were present and no
other topic was discussed. The decisions of this meeting were sent in a
letter from Salazar to the King, dated from Tondo, October 17, 1581,
translated in B. &amp; R., XXXIV, pp. 325&ndash;31, from the original
MS. in the A. of I. (68&ndash;1&ndash;42), Torres, II, no. 2686, p. 95.
The following year a real Synod was held, this time including lay
government officials as well as priests, at which was discussed a
variety of subjects. Robert Streit, <i lang="la">Bibliotheca
Missionum</i>, Aachen, 1928, IV, pp. 327&ndash;31, cites a MS. account
of it by the Jesuit father Sanchez who was present; and Valent&iacute;n
Mar&iacute;n, <i lang="es">Ensayo de una S&iacute;ntesis de los

then in the Archives of the Archiepiscopal Palace of Manila, <i lang=

Qui&ntilde;ones and Plasencia wrote at about the same time: &ldquo;The

Plasencia of the Order of St. Francis, of whom the latter began first,
but the former [wrote] many more things and very useful ones.&rdquo;
However, San Antonio, I, p. 532, wrote perhaps with bias in favor of
his own order, &ldquo;Although the Augustinian fathers had come earlier
and did not lack priests fluent in the idiom, the language had not yet
been reduced to a grammar, so that it could be learned by common
grammatical rules, nor was there a general vocabulary of speech; except

&ldquo;Fray Domingo de Salazar, of the Dominican order, and bishop of
the said islands, has reported to us that he is going to reside in
these islands; and that he will take with him religious of his order to
found monasteries, and to take charge of the conversion and instruction
of the natives,&rdquo; B. &amp; R., IV, p. 141, translated from the
original MS. in the Archivo-Historico Nacional, <i lang="es">Cedulario
indico</i>, t. 31, f. 132V, no. 135. Twelve of the twenty who set out
from Europe with Salazar died before reaching Mexico, and the others
were so sick that all but one remained there, so when Salazar landed at
Manila in March 1581 he was accompanied by twenty Augustinians, eight
Franciscans, and only one Dominican, Christoval de
Salvatierra.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

the Dominicans of Mexico had begun plans for the establishment of a
province in the Orient, and sent Juan Chris&oacute;stomo to Europe to
obtain the necessary permission from lay and ecclesiastical
authorities. The Jesuit Alonso Sanchez, who had been sent to Spain to
explain the situation in the Philippines, was at court, and told the
King and Council of the Indies&mdash;quite subverting his
mission&mdash;that there was no need for more priests and particularly
no need for a new order there. Chris&oacute;stomo was discouraged, but
the scheme was revivified by Juan de Castro who finally secured a
letter from Philip&nbsp;II on September 20, 1585 endorsing the plan.
Twenty-two volunteers sailed from Spain on July 17, 1586. In Mexico the
Dominicans again found Sanchez propagandizing against the mission and
also encountered the efforts of the Viceroy to persuade the friars to
remain there. Notwithstanding, twenty friars subscribed to a set of
ordinances at the Convent of Santo Domingo in Mexico on December 17,
1586. Of the twenty, fifteen went to the Philippines, three went
directly to China, and Juan Chris&oacute;stomo, who was ill and weak,
and Juan Cobo, who had business there, stayed behind in
Mexico.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e1135src">&uarr;</a></p>

Sangley, a term used by the natives to designate Chinese, was derived
from the Cantonese <i>hiang</i> (or <i>xiang</i>) and <i>ley</i>
meaning a &ldquo;travelling merchant.&rdquo; It was adopted by the
Spaniards and in most instances used interchangeably with Chinese. If
any distinction existed it was that a Sangley was a permanent resident
of the Philippines&mdash;quite contrary to the derivation of the
word&mdash;or a Chinese of partially native blood. See San Agustin, p.

good deal. The first year in the Philippines he was with Benavides at
Baybay; the second year he was in Pangasinan. In 1590 he was ordered to
the Chinese mission in Cobo&rsquo;s place by Castro before he left for
China. When Castro got back and Cobo could resume his old station, San
Pedro Martyr went to the vicariate of Bataan &ldquo;the language of

Medina, p. xix, supposed that the Doctrina was printed in the Hospital
of San Gabriel in Minondoc, but Aduarte, I, p. 107, says that when the
village of Baybay became overcrowded, it became necessary to spread the
Chinese Christian settlement to a new site directly across the river,
where land was given them by Don Luis P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as,
the son and successor of G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as,
and there a second church of San Gabriel was built. According to an
inscription on a painting of Don Luis, exhibited at the St. Louis Fair
of 1904 and illustrated in B. &amp; R., XXX, p. 228, he bought the land
from Don Antonio Velada on March 28, 1594, so that San Gabriel of
Minondoc could not have been the place where the 1593 volumes were
printed. Marin, <i>op. cit.</i>, II, p. 617, says that San Gabriel was
moved several years after its foundation to Binondo at the request of
the city, and was rebuilt twice. It is apparent that San Gabriel in the
Parian was abandoned after the church in Binondo was
built.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e1393src">&uarr;</a></p>

de Vera was probably a comparatively common name at this time, because
upon baptism the natives and Chinese assumed any Spanish name they
pleased, and since Santiago de Vera was governor from 1584 to 1590, his
last name would have been very popular. Aduarte, I, p. 86, mentions an
Indian chief, Don Juan de Vera, who helped the Dominicans in
Pangasinan, and Retana, col. 23, quotes from a document sent by the

<h3 class="main">Encoding</h3>
<p class="first">The HTML version of the Tagalog Doctrina Christiana
uses the Old-Tagalog Baybayin script. These characters have been
encoded following the Unicode standard, and require a Unicode-compliant
Baybayin font to render correctly. A font, Tagalog Doctrina 1593,
developed by <a class="exlink xd25e27" title="External link" href=
"http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/bayeng1.htm">Paul Morrow</a>, has been
included with this ebook, in the fonts directory in a file called
TagDoc93.ttf. This particular font is based on the character shapes as
used in this book.</p>
